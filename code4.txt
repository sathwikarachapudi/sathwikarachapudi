Issues and solutions:
1.	Recursion: The original code made recursive calls to merge_sort(left) and merge_sort(right), but it didn't capture the sorted results of these recursive calls. I modified the code to update the left and right subarrays with the sorted results.
2.	Merging: The merging step was missing in the original code. I added comments to clarify the merging process, where the sorted elements from the left and right subarrays are compared and merged into the original array (arr).
Now, the corrected code should properly implement the merge sort algorithm and produce the correct sorted output.
